# FloodSense: South Sudan - Domain-Specific Chatbot

A specialized chatbot providing flood risk information for communities in South Sudan, built using transformer models.

## Project Overview

FloodSense is a domain-specific chatbot designed to provide critical flood risk information for communities in South Sudan. The chatbot uses a fine-tuned T5 transformer model to understand user queries and provide relevant, accurate responses about flood risks, preparation guidelines, emergency contacts, and more.

### Domain Focus: Flood Risk Management in South Sudan

This chatbot specializes in providing information about:
- Region-specific flood risk assessments
- Seasonal flooding patterns and predictions
- Emergency preparation guidelines
- Evacuation center locations
- Emergency contact information
- Climate impact insights

## Dataset

The chatbot is trained on a custom dataset of question-answer pairs related to flood risk in South Sudan. The dataset includes:
- 500+ question-answer pairs covering flood-related topics
- Region-specific flood risk information for 7 major regions
- Preparation and safety guidelines based on international standards
- Seasonal flood patterns derived from historical data
- Climate impact information from scientific reports

The dataset was created by combining:
1. Regional risk information
2. Expert knowledge about flood preparation and response
3. Generated question variations to improve model generalization

## Model Architecture

The chatbot uses a fine-tuned T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model from Hugging Face, implemented using TensorFlow. T5 was chosen for its:
- Strong performance on generative question-answering tasks
- Ability to handle both extractive and generative QA
- Efficient fine-tuning with limited data
- Reasonable inference speed for deployment

### Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Tokenization using T5Tokenizer
- Input formatting as "question: {question}"
- Padding and truncation to appropriate sequence lengths
- Train-validation split (80%-20%)

### Domain-Specific Query Handling

The chatbot implements specialized domain detection to:
- Recognize and respond to flood-related queries
- Appropriately reject out-of-domain questions with Google search referrals
- Provide helpful guidance when users ask about topics outside its expertise

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Multiple hyperparameter configurations were tested to optimize performance:
| Configuration | Learning Rate | Batch Size | Epochs | Val Loss | Performance |
|---------------|--------------|------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Config 1      | 1e-4         | 4          | 2      | 1.87     | Baseline    |
| Config 2      | 5e-5         | 8          | 3      | 1.62     | **Best**    |
| Config 3      | 3e-5         | 8          | 4      | 1.65     | Good        |

The best performance was achieved with Configuration 2 (learning rate: 5e-5, batch size: 8, epochs: 3), showing a 13.4% improvement over the baseline configuration.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:
1. **ROUGE scores** - Measuring the quality of generated responses against reference answers
2. **BLEU score** - Evaluating the precision of generated text
3. **F1 score** - Assessing overall accuracy of responses
4. **Qualitative testing** - Manual review of responses for accuracy and helpfulness

### Results

**Training Performance:**
- Final Training Loss: 1.74
- Final Validation Loss: 0.72
- Training Time: 557 seconds (9.3 minutes)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **ROUGE-1**: 41.87
- **ROUGE-2**: 32.77
- **ROUGE-L**: 40.67
- **BLEU score**: 0.2747
- **F1 score**: 0.3747
- **Out-of-Domain Accuracy**: 100.0%

**Model Testing Results:**
‚úÖ **In-Domain Queries**: Successfully answers flood-related questions with accurate, detailed responses  
‚úÖ **Out-of-Domain Detection**: Perfect rejection of non-flood queries with appropriate referrals  
‚úÖ **Hybrid System**: Combines rule-based responses with AI-generated answers for optimal performance  
‚úÖ **Real-time Performance**: Fast inference with consistent response quality

The model successfully handles domain-specific queries while perfectly rejecting out-of-domain questions. The hybrid approach (rule-based + AI model) ensures reliable responses for flood-related queries and appropriate referrals for non-domain topics.

## User Interface

The chatbot is deployed as a Streamlit web application with a clean, intuitive interface:
1. **Chat Interface** - Interactive chatbot with message history
2. **History Tab** - Access to previous conversations
3. **File Upload** - Support for uploading documents
4. **Google Search Referral** - Automatic referral for out-of-domain questions

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/floodsense-chatbot.git
cd floodsense-chatbot
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This project requires Python 3.8+ and TensorFlow 2.12.0.

3. **Run the application (auto-setup on first run)**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### üöÄ First Run Setup
**The chatbot will automatically:**
- Generate the flood risk dataset (500+ Q&A pairs)
- Train the T5 model (10-15 minutes)
- Start the interface when ready

### üìä Manual Operations (Optional)
```bash
# Generate dataset only
python generate_dataset.py

# Train model only  
python train_model.py

# Evaluate performance
python evaluate_model.py

# Test model responses
python test_model.py
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **First run takes 10-15 minutes** for model training
- **Subsequent runs start immediately**
- Use `streamlit run app.py` (not `python app.py`)
- Requires stable internet for model downloads
